# Bottle-Opener
The Bottle Opener is a simple, low-cost, 3D-printable handheld tool to help those with arthritis, limited finger dexterity or other related disabilities open or close plastic screw-on caps on various beverage bottles, cleaning products, condiments. The bottle opener allows users to remove or replace the lids of these jugs with a small squeeze on a large, rounded gripping surface. The Bottle Opener has several modified versions to open different sizes of containers. The different sizes are named by the approximate diameter of the caps they can open in millimeters.
